          <p>When the UN met at the Sustainable Development Summit in September of 2015, a total of 17 goals were established to summarize the main areas countries should focus on to ensure sustainable development. These goals established how economic growth must be considered side-by-side with social equality and environmental protection to ensure that the world is more sustainable by the year 2030. While 193 of those countries have agreed to follow these policies, many of them have found national debt to be a crippling issue within meeting the 17 SDGs, especially for LEDCs.
While the majority of development financing increased from 2015 to 2019, the amount of unsustainable debt among both MEDCs and LEDCs had increased significantly as well. Even if we were to completely disregard the devastating blows that the Covid-19 pandemic had on the global debt, the amount of fiscal space that had been left had been dwindling since 2019, and it doesn’t seem to be reversing with current policies. Given the gradual increase of countries moving towards debt distress, the feasibility of reaching sustainable development has been somewhat halted across the world. This isn’t to say that no improvements have been made; countries following the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have definitely been making strides of great progress under great economic prosperity throughout the 2010s. However, gradual increases in national debt and global crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, have decreased the leeway for becoming more sustainable, and can become a huge roadblock within the foreseeable future if policies aren’t appropriately amended to account for this.
